# SurvivalShooter
A sample unity game where I am experimenting new features and other epic stuffs in my free time. Thanks unity for the game template !
The base game is a player shooting enemies which eventually will try to overwhelm the player. A score system is also there.

## New Functionalities 
__###### Added healthbar for enemies__
Enemies will hame a small healthbar on top of them so that player can see how much health is remaining. Strategy is to help player determine the enemy health so that tthey can prioritise whom to shoot and run away as enemies tend to overwhelm the player.

###### Killed enemies drop point balls which can be collected by player
Once an enemy is killed, it will drop a point ball which can be collected by the player for extra points. Different enemies drop different coloured balls with varying points.

###### Health Bar fluctuation when under attack by player
When an enemy is under attack by the player , its health bar will flash. It helps player to know which enemy is getting hit when firing the gun.

###### Probability system in enemies droping point balls and point balls expiry
A system is implemented in which not all the enemies will drop the point balls. Its based on probability that a killed enemy has 50% chance to drop a point ball and other 50% chance to not drop a point ball.
Also a point ball has a specified time period after which it will disapper. So player has to collect it before it disapper to get the points

###### Pause and exit functionality
Implemented UI elements to pause the game and also to exit the game as player wishes.

###### Extra Sounds
Extra sounds are added , lastest being sound for collecting the point balls.
